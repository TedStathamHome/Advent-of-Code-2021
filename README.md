# Advent-of-Code-2021
## My solutions to the [2021 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2021) of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

It is a single _Visual Studio_ solution, authored in _VS2019_ using .NET Core 5 C# console applications. Each of the 25 days is its own project, containing the C# code, as well as the puzzle input. The solutions here work, but they may not be the most efficient implementations. As of this writing (March 10, 2022) there are still a few days I have to complete, and eventually I will get them done.

Usually there are two or more puzzle input files.
- The ones that end with **"-test"** contain the sample input shown in the puzzle description, and were used to vet out the solution logic before working with the official puzzle input.
- The ones that end with **"-full"** contain the input that was generated specifically for my Advent of Code account. As such, you can't submit an answer for your account using my input, so make sure you use your own puzzle input. And please don't attempt to push your puzzle input into my repo; doing so will get it rejected.
